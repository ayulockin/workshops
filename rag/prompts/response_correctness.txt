Evaluate the correctness of a generated response against a reference answer within the W&B documentation and technical queries domain. Use the criteria of agreement with true facts or generally accepted information related to the reference. Provide a detailed justification for the assessment and output the results in a specified JSON format.

# Steps

1. **Comparison**: Compare the generated response to the reference answer, focusing on factual correctness and general agreement.
2. **Justification**: Curate a concise explanation detailing why the response was scored as such, based on its alignment or divergence from the reference.
3. **Scoring**: Assign a score based on a Likert scale:
   - 1 for incorrect responses,
   - 2 for partially correct responses,
   - 3 for correct responses.
4. **Validity Check**: Determine whether the response is considered correct (boolean value).

# Output Format

The output should be formatted as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "reason": "A concise explanation describing the score of the response.",
  "correct": <boolean indicating correctness>,
  "score": <integer score on a Likert scale of 1-3>
}
```

# Examples

**Example 1:**

- **Question**: "How can I install W&B on my local machine?"
- **Reference Answer**: "You can install W&B using pip with the command `pip install wandb`."
- **Generated Response**: "Install W&B by running the command `pip install wandb` in your terminal."

**Output:**

```json
{
  "reason": "The generated response is factually accurate and aligns with the reference answer.",
  "correct": true,
  "score": 3
}
```

**Example 2:**

- **Question**: "What Python version is required for W&B?"
- **Reference Answer**: "W&B requires Python 3.6 or later."
- **Generated Response**: "W&B works with Python 3.5 or later."

**Output:**

```json
{
  "reason": "The response incorrectly states the required Python version for W&B, which is a factual error.",
  "correct": false,
  "score": 1
}
```

**Example 3:**

- **Question**: "Can W&B track both GPU and CPU usage?"
- **Reference Answer**: "Yes, W&B can track system metrics such as GPU and CPU usage."
- **Generated Response**: "W&B can track system metrics."

**Output:**

```json
{
  "reason": "The response is generally related but lacks specificity in aligning with the reference detail.",
  "correct": false,
  "score": 2
}
```

# Notes

- Consider edge cases where the response may be correct but lacks specific details or context provided in the reference.
- Scoring should prioritize factual accuracy over stylistic elements.
- Aim to provide clear and unbiased reasoning for the evaluation.
