    "\n",

    "* **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Assesses the quality of the ranked retrieval results, giving more importance to relevant documents appearing earlier.\n",
    "* **MAP (Mean Average Precision)**: Computes the mean precision across all relevant documents retrieved, considering the rank of each relevant document.\n",
    "* **Precision**: Measures the ratio of relevant documents retrieved to the total documents retrieved by the retriever.\n",

The query enhancer uses a LLM to generate the search queries and intents predictions. We then manually route these to the retriever and response generator. It also made use of Structured Outputs to return the results in a structured format. - This was an example of an llm using tool calling. \n",
